export const areFleasTicksDangerous =
  "Both fleas and ticks are considered dangerous. They can create health risks, and transmit diseases and parasites to both people and animals. Flea infestations can quickly get out of control because fleas lay eggs in such large numbers. At a rate of 40 to 50 per day for around 50 days, a single female flea can produce 2,000 eggs in her lifetime. Some pets develop severe allergies to flea saliva, called flea allergy dermatitis, and develop signs, such as itching, that may last long after the fleas have gone. Fleas are also responsible for transmitting the dog tapeworm, Dipylidium Caninum, to dogs, cats, and even humans. In addition, fleas can spread bacterial diseases, too. Huge numbers of newly developed adult fleas can then remain dormant inside cocoons or nests in your home for weeks to months. When the conditions are right — a combination of heat, carbon dioxide, and movement — they will emerge from these cocoons as young and hungry adult fleas.";

export const whatAreWasps =
  "Wasps are a class of flying stinging insects that have over 30,000 different species across the planet. Due to the number of species of wasps, it is hard to generalize their appearance and behavior. There are solitary wasps that go their entire lives with minimal interaction with other wasps of their species and there are social wasps that are part of a larger colony they contribute too. They come in a wide variety of colors and sizes, but the most common species are easily identified by their black and yellow appearance. If you are experiencing what you believe may be a wasp infestation, please contact your local professionals at Williamson Pest Solutions. One of our trained professionals will help you properly identify the species and offer safe and affordable treatment plans.";

export const areWaspsDangerous =
  "Most wasps also share a defense mechanism. They are capable of using a sharp, smooth stinger to deliver a small amount of venom. This can be used as defense as well as for hunting other insects that they feed on. Most wasps are omnivorous and will mostly feed on nectar and insects. That said, when food resources run low, they will scavenge for food at picnics and outdoor parties in search of sugary drinks and protein rich foods. ";

export const whatAreBees =
  "There are three types of bees we most commonly see in Texas. These species of bees are the honeybee, bumblebee, and carpenter bee. The honeybee is a widely distributed flying insect known for its ability to collect nectar from flowers and produce honey. The bumblebee is large, fuzzy insects with short, stubby wings. They are larger than honeybees, but they don't produce as much honey. The carpenter bee is under the classification of WDI (Wood-Destroying-Insect). Carpenter bees get their name from their habit of boring into wood. Carpenter bees do not eat wood but cause damage to structures by drilling circular holes creating tunnels inside wood. If you are experiencing what you believe may be a wasp infestation, please contact your local professionals at Williamson Pest Solutions. One of our trained professionals will help you properly identify the species and offer safe and affordable treatment plans.";

export const areBeesDangerous =
  "Honeybees are social and docile creatures and won’t start a fight unless someone backs them into a corner. Bees are not usually dangerous (although they can be when push comes to shove), but they are endangered. Whether bumble bees are dangerous or not largely depends on how you treat them. Although they are much more docile than wasps and less prone to swarm than honey bees, they can become aggressive if they think you are a threat. Carpenter bees can be a nuisance, but they are not generally dangerous to humans. However, their nests can cause damage to wooden structures such as houses and decks, and their aggressive behavior can be alarming. Moreover, their stings can be painful, but they are not usually life-threatening unless the person is allergic to bee stings.";

Some of these ant species are to include Carpenter Ants, Fire Ants, Crazy Ants, Ghost Ants, Pavement Ants, Rover Ants, Sugar Ants, Pharoah Ants, Leafcutter Ants, and many more. Several are considered common household/lawn pests, but only one is considered a serious nuisance to humans-the Imported Red Fire Ant. Fire ants are an invasive species, and over two-thirds of Texas and a few urban areas are presently infested.

export const whatAreBedbugs =
  "Bedbugs are small, oval, brown insects that feed on the blood of animals and humans. Adult bedbugs have flat bodies about the size of an apple seed. After feeding, though, they swell and turn reddish in color. Their flattened bodies make it possible for them to fit into tiny spaces, about the width of a credit card. This means they can get just about anywhere as long as there’s blood to feed on. Bedbugs do not make nests like ants or bees, but tend to live in groups in hiding places. They don’t fly, but they can move quickly over floors, walls, and ceilings. If you are experiencing what you believe may be a wasp infestation, please contact your local professionals at Williamson Pest Solutions. One of our trained professionals will help you properly identify the species and offer safe and affordable treatment plans.";

Please consult your doctor if this happens to you.  ";

export const preventBedbugs =
  "Bedbug prevention involves inspecting and cleaning your bedroom, furniture, luggage, and other potential hiding places for bedbugs.

export const whatAreRoaches =
  "In Texas, we frequently get service calls regarding five species of cockroaches. These five most common include German cockroaches, Asian cockroaches, American cockroaches, Oriental Cockroaches and Smoky Brown. German Cockroaches are typically found in residential and commercial kitchens or bathrooms. German roaches are indoor pests. While rare, they can survive outdoors in warm weather. German cockroaches have an extraordinary rate of reproduction. One female cockroach and her offspring can theoretically produce hundreds of thousands of offspring a year! Asian cockroaches are relatively newcomers to the United States. Similar in appearance to the German Cockroach, but they aren’t your typical home invader. The Asian cockroach is an outdoor species that most commonly lives in shaded areas. They especially like living in mulch and grass, where their numbers can rise into the ten thousands. They’re rarely known to be seen indoors. American cockroaches are more commonly known as “tree roaches.” This species in larger than any of the others in size, with an average length of 1.6 inches and a height from the surface of about 0.28 inches. Oriental cockroaches or “water bugs” as they are commonly called have smooth, shiny bodies and range in color from black to dark brown. The smoky brown cockroach is an outdoor roach that lives in and around wooded areas. It’s a large species that’s sensitive to changes in the environment and looks for areas of high humidity. It’s also a problem for homes in warmer climates. In addition to their more natural habitats, Smoky Browns infest garbage and have been found in sewers, making them potential carriers of disease. They’re unpleasant pests to find around your house and shouldn’t be taken lightly. If you are experiencing what you believe may be a roach infestation, please contact your local professionals at Williamson Pest Solutions. One of our trained professionals will help you properly identify the species and offer safe and affordable treatment plans.";

export const areRoachesDangerous =
  "Roaches are to harmful to humans because they can carry and transmit bacteria and pathogens that cause diseases like E. coli, salmonella, cholera, typhoid fever, plague, leprosy, and poliovirus. Roaches can also contaminate food, cause allergies, and trigger asthma in some people. Roaches can bite humans in rare cases. Roaches are a global threat and exist all around the world.";

export const whatAreTermites =
  "There are three types of termites that are known to infest in Texas. We have the Eastern Subterranean Termite, Formosan Termite and the Drywood Termite. Eastern Subterranean termites can cause the most damage of any termite species. These termites build distinctive tunnels, often referred to as “mud tubes,” to reach food sources and protect themselves from open air. Formosan termites are often to referred to as “super termites,” as they are the most voracious, aggressive and devious. They are known to chew through wood, flooring and even wallpaper undetected. Drywood termites are a species of termite that typically makes its home in dry wood that forms the structural foundation of a home, as well as within wooden fixtures and furniture inside a home. Drywood termites are most often found above ground and, unlike subterranean termites, do not need to make contact with soil in order to thrive.

export const whatAreMosquitos =
  "Mosquitoes are common, flying insects that live in most parts of the world. Not all mosquitoes bite people or animals. When mosquitoes bite people, the most common reactions to the bite are itching and swelling. Some mosquitoes bite, but do not spread germs. These types of mosquitoes are called nuisance mosquitoes. Adult mosquitoes live for about 2 to 4 weeks depending on the species, humidity, temperature, and other factors. Female mosquitoes often live longer than male mosquitoes.

We charge $125 as a one-time initial fee. This service is going to cover all general pests specific to the season (excluding bed bugs and German roaches). We essentially treat your property as though it has never been treated and perform what we call a “double up spray” on both service and chemical (using double the chemical of what we would normally use on a standard service call and performing twice the service.) We will do a heavy power spray(approx. 25-30 gallons of chemical) on the exterior of your home, covering every crack and crevice. We will then go behind it with our hand tank and treat the ground perimeter inside and out, a granule in the yard that is moisture-activated and several pheromone monitors. These monitors help us monitor activity behind the scenes and are equipped with a scent that draws any insects that may still be lingering – into it. This is most effective for follow-up service. Whenever we come back out a few months later to assess the property and make note of if what we did is fully taking care of your issues, or if it may further require a more extensive approach. The neat apart about how we operate is that we fully customize your service over a period of time and we begin to become familiar with what your property’s’ specific needs are. Unfortunately, there is no ‘one size fits all’ in the pest control world. With your full cooperation and our determination, we will find the best combination of products that specifically cater to your satisfaction. We do offer a full warranty on all of our work. This is exciting news for you because after we come out -- you have peace of mind that if you see anything it will be treated at our cost.",
